Feature: Application Signup
  As a patient
  I want to be able to create an account
  So that the application can gather the required information (Name, email, etc.).

  Background: Users in database      # features/signup.feature:7
    Given the following users exist: # features/step_definitions/signup_steps.rb:1
      | first_name | last_name | phone_number | address_line_1 | address_line_2 | zip   | city            | state        | date_of_birth | email             | password |
      | Test       | User      | 1231231234   | 123 Street     |                | 12345 | College Station | Texas        | 1999-01-01    | testuser@test.com | Test123  |

  Scenario: A new user signups successfully                      # features/signup.feature:13
    When I go to signup                                          # features/step_definitions/signup_steps.rb:7
    And I enter valid patient signup information                 # features/step_definitions/signup_steps.rb:11
    And I click "Sign up"                                        # features/step_definitions/signup_steps.rb:34
    Then I should be redirected to the welcome page              # features/step_definitions/signup_steps.rb:38
    And I should see "Welcome! You have signed up successfully." # features/step_definitions/signup_steps.rb:42
